# Stock-Trend-Prediction-using-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project was part of my 3rd year PD lab project. In this project, raw tweets data were mined. Raw tweets are in random unorganised format. The mined raw tweets were formatted such that the date of posting could be extracted from them along with the accurate time of posting, the tweet id and the twitter handle of the user who posted it. Two text files were prepared from words with known sentiments - positive.txt and negative.txt, containing words,their types and respective sentiment scores. This was followed by tokenization using whitespace as delimiter, removal of standard stopwords, filtering out invalid financial terms and stemming the tokens to their base form. Using the above obtained tokens, their cooresponding counts and TF-IDF scores were obtained as the feature vector. This concludes the sentiment analysis part of the project. A neural network prediction model was trained with 500 hidden neurons using the above extracted features against the DJIA stock trend of the concerned company. The designed model was tested with another set of DJIA stock prices with a minimum of 10 guaranteed epochs and a maximum of 500 epochs.
